    <h4>During software development, programmers often find themselves confronted by a myriad of legal considerations, <br>
        with each regulation holding significant implications for both users, and creators. These considerations <br>
        must be followed to ensure the integrity, and compliance of code, that not only abides by laws and regulations, <br>
        but is also justly moral. <br><br> Programmers should structure their code, around the following most widely known, and encountered regulations to <br>
        ensure they program, and publish an application that utilizes legally moral code:
    </h4>

    <section class="intellectual-property">
        <h2>Intellectual Property:</h2>
        <p>Developers should ensure they adhere to intellectual property regulations by not using copyrighted material, including code,<br> images, audio, or software without proper authorization. They could potentially structure their code to include primarily open<br>source assets and follow GNU licensing terms for free libraries to avoid copyright infringement issues.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="software-patents">
        <h2>Software Patents:</h2>
        <p>Expanding on intellectual property rights, developers can structure their code to ensure it doesnt too include potentially <br>patented software or technology without proper liscensing or permissions. To avoid this they should conduct thorough web <br>searches for patents utilizing the existing technology to identify potential conflicts prior to implementation, or development.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="ownership">
        <h2>Ownership:</h2>
        <p>Software development often involves multiple programmers collaborating on one project. Developers should establish clear <br>ownership agreements amongst their development team to avoid any potential miscommunication or disagreement. Creating repositories <br>and version control systems to track ownership would too help prevent disputes.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="trade-secrets">
        <h2>Trade Secrets:</h2>
        <p>Protecting trade secrets involves keeping sensitive information confidential. The privacy of a users sensitive information <br>is of the utmost importance to a software developer, so they should structure their code to limit access to this data, and <br>implement enhanced cybersecurity procedures and algorithms to prevent unauthorized disclosure through cyberattacks.

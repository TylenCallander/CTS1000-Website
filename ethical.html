        <h2>Addictive Design:</h2>
        <p>Every software developer dreams of creating an application that <br>everyone adores, whether it be an app, website or extension. But<br> these software practices involve more than just appeal, but they <br>too involve incorporating unethical elements that often lead to<br> the development of addictive behaviors.<br><br>For instance, Instagram employs mechanisms like endless scrolling, <br>frequent notifications, and a personalized feed that keeps the user<br> engaged for unhealthy periods of time. These features that enhance <br>user experience also lead to compulsive usage, which often makes it <br>difficult to disengage. <br><br> Software developers should engage in decision-making where they <br>should consider the long term impacts of their designs, where a balance <br>between healthy user engagement and ethica responsibility should be<br> attained to ensure they 	doesn't exploit user vulnerabilities.

    <section class="algorithmic-bias">
        <h2>Algorithmic Bias:</h2>
        <p>Algorithmic bias is another, more newly emerged concern in software<br> development, particularly with the recent emergence of machine <br>learning applications like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard. The applications<br> have been under criticism for being trained on non-diverse, discriminatory <br> and limited data sets. <br><br> In 2018, Amazon utilized an AI recruitment tool to scan resumes. The<br> system tool showed a prejudice against women, as the AI was trained on<br> resumes over a decade old which were predominantly from men, which <br>reflected the male dominance in the tech industry. <br><br> Ethical coding practices should begin with using diverse and inclusive data<br> sets, conduct regular bias checks through testing, and employ potential bias<br> detection algorithms in their code.

    <section class="data-protection">
        <h2>Data Protection:</h2>
        <p>vData protection refers to a software developers responsibility of <br>safeguarding their users personal information against unauthorized<br> access, through either malware or unwarranted distribution. <br><br> MOVEit had a data breach recently this year, that affected 200 <br>organizations and 17.5m of its< users, including federal governments. <br>This breach originated from a vulnerability in the websites code,<br> which allowed hackers to not only access, but also 	distribute the<br> users of MOVEit’s personal information. <br><br> While the software developer may not be entirely at fault in these <br>situations, it is their duty to anticipate vulnerabilities in their <br>code, and implement strong security measures to protect their users <br>and their applications integrity against such breaches.
